First React project ever.It is like a To-Do list,but for Movies.Has user authentication and authorization,very little styling.Main focus here was to understand and use props and state and practice Class-based components.The state of the app(is a user logged in) lives in the App component which led me to my biggest challenge here - how to change state of parent component using information form a child component.Not that it was very hard,it was just conceptiually new to me.Love learning react more and more every day!
